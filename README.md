Connections is an addictive word puzzle game inspired by the New York Times' popular daily puzzle. In this game, players face 16 words that need to be organized into four distinct groups of four, with each group sharing a common theme or connection.

The Connections puzzle features a color-coded difficulty system:
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow (Easiest): Generally straightforward connections (e.g., colors, animals)
- ðŸŸ© Green (Easy-Medium): Common phrases or related concepts
- ðŸŸ¦ Blue (Medium-Hard): Requires deeper thinking and wordplay

Each Connections puzzle challenges players to identify these hidden relationships while managing their limited attempts. The game has gained massive popularity for its perfect blend of vocabulary knowledge, lateral thinking, and puzzle-solving skills.
